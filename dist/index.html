 <b>Blast</b> was the short-lived literary magazine of the <a class="wikiPreview" href="#" data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='Vorticist'>Vorticist</a> movement in Britain. Two editions were published: the first on 2 July 1914 (dated 20 June 1914, but publication was delayed) and published with a bright pink cover, referred to by <a class="wikiPreview" href="#" data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='Ezra_Pound'>Ezra Pound</a> as the "great MAGENTA cover'd opusculus"; and the second a year later on 15 July 1915. Both editions were written primarily by Wyndham Lewis.  The magazine is emblematic of the modern art movement in England, and recognised as a seminal text of pre-war 20th-century modernism.The magazine originally cost 2/6.
