                       -- On November 10, <a class="wikiPreview" href="#" data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='Kill_Rock_Stars'>Kill Rock Stars</a> will celebrate the 30th anniversary of Delta 5's taunting, scratchy postpunk classic "Mind Your Own Business". The label is reissuing the song as a limited edition 7" single, with the album version on one side and a remix from <a class="wikiPreview" href="#" data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='Man_Ray'>Man Ray</a>, otherwise known as former New Order/Joy Division bassist Peter Hook, on the flip. The label is also reissuing the band's career-spanning compilation Singles and Sessions 1979-81, this time including the Man Ray remix, plus remixes by Deerhoof and Monnei Lamar.

               -- Before becoming an experimental psych cult hero, Michael Yonkers led a garage rock group called Michael and the Mumbles. On November 3, De Stijl will reissue that band's self-titled 1966 album on vinyl. Hear a track from it here.

               -- Hugely successful butt-rockers Kings of Leon have entered the live DVD stage of their career. On November 10, the band will release Live at the O2 London, England, which documents a show in June 2009. The Blu-ray version is due November 24.
